# Research Roadmap — Rust in the Linux Kernel

**Phase 1 — Foundations (Week 1–2)**
- Read and summarize motivation & goals (docs/01-intro-and-motivation.md).
- Build a timeline of key discussions and milestones (docs/02-history.md).

**Phase 2 — Technical Integration (Week 3–4)**
- Kbuild integration, supported subsystems, Rust↔C FFI (docs/03-technical-overview.md).
- Toolchain matrix and reproducible build notes (docs/04-toolchain-and-deps.md).

**Phase 3 — Contribution & Practice (Week 5–6)**
- Env setup for Rust-in-kernel builds; sample Rust driver skeleton (docs/05-dev-and-contrib.md, snippets/).

**Phase 4 — Analysis (Week 7)**
- Challenges, performance, code size, community debates (docs/06-challenges-and-limits.md).

**Phase 5 — Futures (Week 8)**
- Forecast and research questions (docs/07-future-directions.md).

**Living Resources**
- Curated links and primary sources (docs/08-resources.md).

> Use GitHub Projects to track tasks; label issues with `phase:1` … `phase:5`.
